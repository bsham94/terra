# Project Scope

TERRA allows the user to keep track of their fields while looking at specific details pertaining to each field. The system has the ability to track field details such as: yield, seeds planted, fertilizer use, pesticide use, and other details that may come to light as progress is made. The system has the ability to visualize Nasaâ€™s Earth Data overtop of the users fields to give them information about the quality of their field overtime.
